          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="mainText">
              I was born in Afghanistan, now I live in Amsterdam, I have studied computer science, mostly worked as an ICT teacher also as an IT. Currently I am focusing on programming. I would like to specialize in Network security in two years time.
          </p>
          <p class="mainText">
              On the Dutch labor there is a hunt for very skilled ICT people, whom usually have up to date skills. Although I have basic knowledge of programming, and IT management but I have never worked with programmers and did not design any advanced website or application by myself yet. But it is not far, I am working on my it. I am following a B2 to C1 Dutch course, and I am married and I have a very smart son.
